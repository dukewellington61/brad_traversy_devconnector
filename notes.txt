8. Route Files With Express Router
@public and private routes

#private routes
for example to add a profile you need to be authenticated
so you need to send along a token to that route (some middleware will handle this)

#public routes don't need tokens

16. Get Current User Profile

mongoose returns a promise 

when ever an API returns a promise we need async await


****web token****

if a user logs in or a user registers (new user is created) that user gets a web token
the web token is then beeing send along with every request that the user makes 
this identifies a valid user if that user accesses protected routes such as the profile routes which return the profile of that user
which profile is to be returned is determined by the user's id which is part of the web token

40. Auth Reducer & Register Action client/src/reducers/auth.js

2) Hmm, there's a pretty big difference if you include or exclude that spread operator. Let's say our payload object looks like:

{
    token: "abc123xyz789"
}
If you include the spread operator, the auth state will look like:

{
    user: { ... }, // ignoring the full object here for brevity
    token: "abc123xyz789",
    isAuthenticated: true,
    loading: false
}
If you exclude the spread operator, the state will become:

{
    user: { ... }, // ignoring the full object here for brevity
    payload: {
        token: "abc123xyz789",
    },
    isAuthenticated: true,
    loading: false
}
payload is now a key, containing a nested object with our token. There's nothing inherently wrong with this, but our application certainly may get confused when trying to find the token.


41. Load User & Set Auth Token

Load User --> everytime the App.js component is loaded the web token which is stored in local storage is beeing send to the back end for validation (authentication) and the user is loaded --> the point of this is to see if we are logged in, it'll also give us the user data 


42. User Login

done except one thing: in actions/auth.js we have dispatch(loadUser()); why dispatch, why not simplay call loadUser function --> answer to that in link below
https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-stack-front-to-back/learn/lecture/14555612#questions/10123662

question asked: 

So we need to dispatch a function call (as oppose to calling that function the normal way i.e. without dispatch) whenever the function that is called is changing the state. Is this the way it works?

wait for answer
