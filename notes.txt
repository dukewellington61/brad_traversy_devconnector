8. Route Files With Express Router
@public and private routes

#private routes
for example to add a profile you need to be authenticated
so you need to send along a token to that route (some middleware will handle this)

#public routes don't need tokens

16. Get Current User Profile

mongoose returns a promise 

when ever an API returns a promise we need async await


****web token****

if a user logs in or a user registers (new user is created) that user gets a web token
the web token is then beeing send along with every request that the user makes 
this identifies a valid user if that user accesses protected routes such as the profile routes which return the profile of that user
which profile is to be returned is determined by the user's id which is part of the web token
